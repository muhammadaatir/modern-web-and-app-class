index -> home file


sibling ->  file/folder  on same path -> direct name / "./"

 
parent -> file/folder outside of the path->"../" through this we can access parent directory and all the siblings in parent directory


grandparent -> file/folder one step outside of parent -> "../../" thorough grantparent directory

children -> file/ folder inside of a sibling folder -> we use "/" to access children of any directory/folder

grandchild -> file/folder inside of sibling of parent folder -> we use "/" to acces child then again after name we use "/" to reach grand child directory
